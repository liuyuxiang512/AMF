# AMF: Attention-based Multi-task Field-probing Networks for 3D Data

3D Data classification. Dataset: ModelNet40.

### Introduction
We propose a way for learning both global and local features from 3D data, based on **FPNN** <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06240" target="_blank">research paper</a> (was accepted to NIPS 2016).

### Usage
Check <a href="https://github.com/liuyuxiang/AMF/tree/master/training_settings" target="_blank">training settings</a> for example usage of the field probing layers.
