Guibas</a> from Stanford University.

### Introduction
We propose a light-weight way for learning features from 3D data. See more details from our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06240" target="_blank">research paper on arXiv</a> (was accepted to NIPS 2016).

### Usage
Check <a href="https://github.com/yangyanli/FPNN/tree/master/training_settings" target="_blank">training settings</a> for example usage of the field probing layers, as well as logs generated during our training.

### From FPNN to PointCNN
If you are interested in FPNN, we highly recommend you take a look at [PointCNN](https://github.com/yangyanli/PointCNN), which outperforms FPNN in terms of ModelNet40 classification, together with other advantages.
