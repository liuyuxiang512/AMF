 Header for PLY polygon files.

 - Greg Turk

 A PLY file contains a single polygonal _object_.

 An object is composed of lists of _elements_.  Typical elements are
 vertices, faces, edges and materials.

 Each type of element for a given object has one or more _properties_
 associated with the element type.  For instance, a vertex element may
 have as properties three floating-point values x,y,z and three unsigned
 chars for red, green and blue.
